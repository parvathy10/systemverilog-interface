# Arbiter Design README

## Overview
The arbiter is a hardware component responsible for arbitrating between multiple competing requests for a shared resource. It determines the order in which requests are granted access to the resource based on predefined priority or fairness criteria. This README provides an overview of the arbiter design, its features, usage instructions, design details, testing methodologies, performance characteristics, limitations, and suggestions for future improvements.

## Features
- Prioritized arbitration of requests
- Support for multiple request inputs and a single grant output
- Configurable arbitration policies (e.g., round-robin, fixed priority)
- Scalable design for large-scale systems

## Getting Started
To get started with the arbiter project, follow these steps:
1. Clone the repository: `git clone https://github.com/your_username/arbiter.git`
2. Install any dependencies required for building or simulating the arbiter.
3. Set up the development environment according to the provided instructions.

## Usage
To use the arbiter in your hardware design, follow these instructions:
1. Instantiate the arbiter module in your Verilog/VHDL code.
2. Connect the request inputs and grant output to other components in your system.
3. Configure the arbiter parameters (e.g., number of request inputs, arbitration policy) as needed.
arbitration latency and resource utilization are provided in the documentation.
