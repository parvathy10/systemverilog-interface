# Arbiter Design README

## Overview..
The arbiter is a hardware component responsible for arbitrating between multiple competing requests for a shared resource. 
This repository contains an arbiter module implemented in SystemVerilog, accompanied by a comprehensive testbench and an interface top-level design. The arbiter module is designed to arbitrate between multiple request signals and grant access to a shared resource based on a priority scheme.

## Features..
- Prioritized arbitration of requests
- Support for multiple request inputs and a single grant output
- Configurable arbitration policies 
- Scalable design for large-scale systems

## Getting Started..
To get started with the arbiter project, follow these steps:
1 Install any dependencies required for building or simulating the arbiter.
2. Set up the development environment according to the provided instructions.

## Usage..
To use the arbiter in your hardware design, follow these instructions:
1. Instantiate the arbiter module in your Verilog/VHDL code.
2. Connect the request inputs and grant output to other components in your system.
3. Configure the arbiter parameters (e.g., number of request inputs, arbitration policy) as needed.
